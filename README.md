# Penetration testing scripts

This repository contains a collection of pen test scripts for security researchers.
I will try and upload several scripts, however, this may take some time as I intend to write a readme for each script.

## Motivation

There are plenty of tools available, however, sometimes we need to use our own intuition to automate/accomplish certain tasks.
As a former Ethical Hacking student, I am sharing/relocating my scripts on github for others to potentially benefit.
Please do not use these scripts for illegal or malicious attacks.
