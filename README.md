# Collection of penetration testing scripts

This repository contains a collection of pen testing scripts for security researchers.
More scripts will be available in this repo in the future.

## Motivation

There are plenty of tools available, however sometimes we need to use our own intuition to automate/accomplish certain tasks.
As a former Ethical Hacking student, I am sharing/relocating my scripts on github for others to potentially benefit.

## Fair use

Script should be used for the purpose of serving the needs of specified educational/research programs.
Do not use the acquired scripts for illegal or malicious attacks!
